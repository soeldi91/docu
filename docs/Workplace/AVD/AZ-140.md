## Azure Virtual Desktop Experience Estimator
Use the estimation tool to view the round trip time your end users would experience with Windows Virtual Desktop. The tool uses the location of the device used to access it to determine round trip times to each Azure region via the Windows Virtual Desktop infrastructure

## VM Size

A = Entry Level for dev/test
B = Economical Burstable
D = Gerneral Purpose Compute
E = optimized for in-memory hyper-threaded applications
F = Compute optimized VMs
L = Storage optimized
M = Memory optimized
N = GPU enabled

Series Examples:
- Av2
- Dsv4
- NVv3

## Images

1. Create an Azure compute gallery
2. Crealte an image definition
3. Create an image version

# Implement an Azure Virtual Desktop Infrastructure
## FS Logix
Netapp:
Create a NetApp account
Create a capacity pool
Configure an Active Directory connection
Create a volume

## RDP Shortpath (Preview):
Port 3390 über UDP
Bessere Performance

## Load Balancing Algorithm (Pooled)
- Breadth-first
    - Breadth-first load balancing allows you to evenly distribute user sessions across the session hosts in a host pool

- Depth-first


## MSIX
1. Generate a signing certificate
2. Create an MSIX package
3. Create an MSIX image
4. Upload the MSIX image to Share1

## Location
App Group and Workspace in same location as the host pool

## Sysprep
System Preparation Tool (sysprep.exe) provides an "out of the box" experience by removing all personal data and resetting several components.

## Storage Replication
- Geo-redudant (GRS)
    - copies your data synchonously three times within a single physical location in the primary region using LRS. It then copies your data asynchronously to a single physical location in a secondary region that is hundreds of miles away from the primary region.

- Geo-zone-redundant (GZRS)
    - is more expensive compared to GRS
    - combines the high availability provided by redundancy across availability zones with protection from regional outages provided by geo-replication.
    - Data in a GZRS storage account is copied across three Azure availability zones in the primary region and is also replicated to a secondary geographic region for protection from regional disasters

- Locally-redundant (LRS)
    - copies your data synchonously three times within a single physical location in the primary region.
    - is the least expensive replication option, but isn`t recommended for applications requiring high availability or durability

- Zone-redundant (ZRS)
    - copies your data synchronously across three Azure availability zones in the primary region
    - for applications requiring high availability, Microsoft recommends using ZRS in the primary region, and slo replicating to a secondary region

# Plan and implement user environments and apps
For FS Logix the Storage Account must be joined to the ADDS Domain

Cloud Cache is an add-on to FSLogix. It uses a local cache to service all reads from a redirected Profile or Office Container, after the first read. Cloud Cache also allows the use of multiple remote locations, which are all continuously updated during the user session, creating true real-time profile replication

# Monitor and Maintain and Azure Virtual Desktop Infrastructure

## Disaster Recovery
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-desktop/disaster-recovery
Azure Site Recovery failover of the session hosts
- For personal host pools with dedicated VMs, replicate VMs using Azure Site Recovery to another region
- Geo-redundant storage (GRS) copies your data synchronously three times within a single physical location in the primary region using LRS.

# Azure Traffice Manager
Azure Traffic Manager is a DNS-based traffic load balancer. This service allows you to distribute traffic to your public facing applications across the global Azure regions. Traffic Manager also provides your public endpoints with high availability and quick responsiveness.
